Consider the principles and techniques we have been repeatedly practicing and emphasizing in this course. But, for this exercise, we will fly without tests. 

Demonstrate your ability to refactor this code, that showcases your assimilation of the ideas and principles in this course. (Note: we are being intentionally vague here, to force your hand in recalling, applying, and demonstrating the principles and practice we have seen in this course.)
